===============================

In this game there is a Player (controlled by the user) and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

To play:

The player avatar can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys. When the player reaches the water, a point is scored.  When the points total "10", the player has won the game.

The enemies move in varying speeds from left to right across the scene. If the player collides with an enemy while crossing to the water, the the player loses a "life" and the player position is reset back to the start square.

The player gets five "lives" at the start of the game.  If the player's life tally decreases to zero, the game is lost.
